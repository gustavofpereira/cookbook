### :octocat: Ingredients

- 150g 70% dark chocolate, plus extra to serve
- 6 white eggs
- 2 tbsp golden caster sugar
- 4 tbsp crème fraîche and grated chocolate, to serve

### :construction: Method

1. Melt the chocolate in the microwave in a microwaveable bowl, stirring every 30 seconds until just melted
2. Whisk the white eggs to soft peaks
3. Scatter in the sugar
4. Whisk again until the mixture forms stiff peaks when you lift the whisk out (around 30 seconds)

### :spoon: Finishing

1. Add a big tablespoon of egg to the melted chocolate
2. Mix vigorously, working fast so the chocolate doesn’t cool and harden
3. Fold in the remaining white eggs carefully using a spatula or large metal spoon
4. Spoon into 4 glasses or ramekins and set in the fridge for 2-3 hours
5. Serve each with a dollop of crème fraiche and shavings of dark chocolate
